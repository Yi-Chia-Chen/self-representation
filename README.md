This is a demonstration of an experiment testing how we perceive the visual feedback our own actions. It is essentially a web game that also collect simply behavioral responses!

The game challenges one's motor control of the cursor and the ability to recognize one's own actions from their consequences.

Note that this is now only a demonstration, so no data will be collected. Feel free to play with it however you like to: https://yi-chia-chen.github.io/self-representation/
